#s – Stopping distance in meters
#t – Perception-reaction time in seconds, this has been replaced with 1.5 as that is the avrage responce time
#v – Speed of the car in km/h.
#G – Grade (slope) of the road, expressed as a decimal. Positive for an uphill grade and negative for a downhill road. This input will be provided by a digital level eithin the car.
#f – Coefficient of friction between the tires and the road. It is assumed to be 0.7 on a dry road and 0.35 on a wet road. This will be determined True of False by the cars rain sensor.
